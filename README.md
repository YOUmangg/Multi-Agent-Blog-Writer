# Multi-Agent-Blog-Writer
A multi-agentic-AI system for writing blogs.

Problem Statement : 
ðŸš¨ Manual Blog Creation is Time-Consuming, Inconsistent, and Inefficient. With the growing demand of content creation I have observed on sites such as LinkedIn and other similar ones, with the low availability of writers we need to make the most out of the available ones; while ensuring quick, correct and efficient writing. In competitive domains, we need to deep research to identify trending & relevant topics, tuning it for better search engine optimization and careful editing for grammar and structure. Traditionally, this would require a team of human specialists, and the process is time-consuming and prone to burnout; along with being costly when outsourced. It can also have inconsistency in tone, quality and SEO.
